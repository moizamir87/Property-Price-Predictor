# Property-Price-Predictor
Property Price Predictor is a website that users can use to predict real estate prices based on input features such as square footage area,number of bedrooms etc. 

This project series provides a comprehensive guide on building a real estate price prediction website. The process involves three main components:

1) Model Building using Scikit-learn and Linear Regression:
➣Utilizes the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com.
➣Implements data loading and cleaning techniques using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
➣Performs data visualization using Matplotlib.
➣Develops a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
➣Covers various data science concepts such as outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and K-fold cross-validation.
➣Python Flask Server Implementation:

2) Develops a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests.
➣Utilizes the saved machine learning model to predict home prices based on user inputs.

3) Website Development using HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
➣Builds a user-friendly website interface where users can input home square footage area, number of bedrooms, etc.
➣Calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price based on user inputs.
➣Technologies and Tools Used

4) This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

➣Python: Main programming language used for model building, server-side scripting, and website development.
➣NumPy and Pandas: Python libraries used for data cleaning and manipulation.
➣Matplotlib: Python library used for data visualization.
➣Scikit-learn: Python library used for machine learning model building.
➣Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) used for coding and development.
➣Python Flask: Micro web framework used for developing the HTTP server.
➣HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Web technologies used for building the user interface of the website.
